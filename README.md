# Description
This is a simple web application for taking notes, with a backend that uses express for API calls and saves to a local file, not a database. It was then deployed onto heroku where it is accessible at https://whispering-plains-24118.herokuapp.com/ 

# Installation
npm i for all the dependencies if you wish to edit the application, otherwise just run the app in heroku

# Usage
if you are on a device with no notes app but it has internet access, utilize this app instead for quick note taking!

# Credits 
heroku and express/node
